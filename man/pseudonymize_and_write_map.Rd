\title{Pseudonymize Data and Create an ID Mapping File}
\usage{
pseudonymize_and_write_map(data, map_cols, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame to which the \code{pseudoID} will be added and from
which the mapping file will be created.}

\item{map_cols}{A character vector specifying the names of the columns
from the input \code{data} that should be included in the pseudonymization
mapping file. These columns will be selected along with \code{pseudoID}.}

\item{path}{A character string specifying the full path (including file name
and extension, e.g., "my_directory/my_map.csv") where the pseudonymization
mapping CSV file will be written.}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to the input \code{data} but with an additional
column named \code{pseudoID}, which contains a unique row number for each
observation.
}
\description{
This function adds a \code{pseudoID} column to a given data frame, creates a
mapping file between the generated \code{pseudoID} and specified original ID
columns, and writes this mapping file to a CSV.
}
\examples{
# Make sure to load dplyr and readr before running this example:
# library(dplyr)
# library(readr)

# Create a dummy data frame for demonstration
dummy_data <- data.frame(
  StudentID = c("S001", "S002", "S003"),
  CalnetUID = c("U101", "U102", "U103"),
  SurveyYear = c(2023, 2023, 2024),
  Value = c(10, 20, 30)
)

# Specify ID columns and a temporary path for the mapping file
temp_map_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".csv")

# Run the function
pseudonymized_data <- pseudonymize_and_write_map(
  data = dummy_data,
  map_cols = "StudentID",
  path = temp_map_path
)

# View the pseudonymized data
print(pseudonymized_data)

# Read and view the created mapping file (for verification)
if (file.exists(temp_map_path)) {
  mapping_file_content <- read.csv(temp_map_path)
  print(mapping_file_content)
  # Clean up the temporary file
  file.remove(temp_map_path)
}

# Example adding additional ID and non-ID columns to map:
# pseudonymized_data <- pseudonymize_and_write_map(
#   data = dummy_data,
#   map_cols = c("Student Id", "Calnet Uid", "SurveyAdminYear"),
#   path = temp_map_path
# )
}
